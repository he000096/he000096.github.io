        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <article>
            <p><strong><em>My name is Qi He. I come from Hohhot, Inner Mongolia, <abbr title="People's Republic of China">PRC</abbr>.</strong></em><br>
                It is an inland city.
                The climate there is very similar to Ottawa, and there is a lot of snow in winter, so I also like Ottawa very much. 
                I hope I can explore more interesting activities in Ottawa in the future.

        <h3>Hobby</h3>
        <article>
            <p> <strong><em>My hobby in my brake time is to do puzzles.</em></strong><br>
                I enjoy doing puzzles of different sizes and difficulties.
                My favorite puzzle is Van Gogh's Starry Sky, which took me about 3 days to complete.
                I like to do puzzles while listening to my favorite songs, which makes my busy life relax.
